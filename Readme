ABSTRACT: A database browser for the infamous 'warlogs' from the two military operations in Iraq respective Afghanistan labeled 'OP Iraqi Freedom (OIF)' and 'OP Enduring Freedom (OEF)'. These databases were stolen by a disloyal private, Bradley Edward Manning, later becoming gender confused by a mental condition 'Gender Dysphoria' and today calling himself 'Chelsea Elizabeth Manning'.

Manning was assigned the role of junior intelligence analyst and committed the crime of espionage when stealing these databases, smuggling them out of base on a pirated 'Lady Gaga' CD and uploading the database to WikiLeaks, an organization known to be acting as an agent for Russia, China and other anti-western entities. He was rightfully sentenced to 35 years imprisonment but the former US President, Barrack Hussein Obama, commuted the sentence and freed Manning after serving only 7 years with credit for time served in custody.

This browser reads the database SQLite files, presents the documents in a nice, windowed TUI with a header containing metadata like document classification, date, geographic position, units involved, EKIA, EWIA, KIA, WIA, etc. provided by ncurses and provides free text search functionality for the document collection. The main document window scrolls when necessary and a status bar at the bottom contains navigation key help, doc status and search status.

NOTE: This repository does NOT contain the warlogs themselves. Even though it's not considered illegal to spread these files since they are already in the public domain, I'm NOT partaking in spreading classified military documents. Are you a serious researcher who wants to access this material, you know how to find them and how to change and re-compile this tool to use either one (or just rename the database).

THIS IS A PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
